						<p class="details">I was thrilled to be selected as a Web Development intern at Next24 Technologies, a dynamic startup based in Noida. This opportunity came through the government internship portal AICTE and spanned two months in an online format. Each week, I received various tasks that I needed to complete before their respective deadlines and present during our weekly meetings. My responsibilities ranged from creating Figma designs and implementing frontend features to handling backend operations like authentication, validation, and session management. Additionally, I worked on developing parody websites and continually expanded my knowledge by learning new concepts.</p>

For this project, I had the flexibility to use any tools, allowing me to practice and experiment with various technologies. The form I developed allows users to complete each step of the sequence, return to previous steps to update their selections, and view a summary of their choices in the final step before confirming their order. It also adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal layout and includes hover and focus states for all interactive elements.

It includes validation errors if any field is empty, the day number is not between 1-31, the month number is not between 1-12, the date is in the future, or the date is invalid (e.g., 31/04/1991, as April has 30 days). Additionally, the app adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal layout and includes hover and focus states for all interactive elements. As a bonus, the age numbers animate to their final values when the form is submitted.</p>
